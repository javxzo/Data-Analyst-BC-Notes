Typically, data that has some kind of address or map, will generate this longitude and latitutde map.
Longitude - columns, latitude - rows.
- We can put postal code in marks to see locations on the map.
- If we alter size (and make it really small), we can see the areas on the map that are more densely populated.

- We can also try putting state/province in and change the automatic drop down to a map. It'll show all the states in which that store is currently located.
- In the same drop down, you can also change it to density to turn it into a density map.
