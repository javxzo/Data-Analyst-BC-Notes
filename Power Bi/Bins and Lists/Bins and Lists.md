- You can give it the number of bins and it will tell you the size.
- You can also switch to Size of Bins under bin type and give it the bin size of 10. 
- We can do the same with dates
When creating visualizations, you can use your bins/list as the first field in your x axis, and the same column (without bin format) underneath. Like:
- Age(bins)
- Age
So that you can drill down even further.
