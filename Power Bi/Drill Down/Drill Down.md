### Drill Down/Drill Up
- Drill down is extremely useful, its the organization of data in different ways within the same graph set. 
- Let's start with this:

Note that on our x-axis, we have store and product. This order is our hierarchy.

This option shows up with our hierarchy and when we click it and then click on target, it shows as follows:

It drills down into the bars where we can define more information about products per store.

We can also go down the next level of hierarchy.

We can also expand all down one level in the heirarchy.

### Real life example with operations
- working with order_ids, product_ids...
- We start off with customer and units sold:
  ![alt text](images\image-5.png) 
- "We wanna see the order_ids with it... What orders are happening for each of these groups?"
- We can take order_id and slide it underneath customer.
- Turn on drill down mode and click on a group to show all the order_ids associated with that group in this format.
